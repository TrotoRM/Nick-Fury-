# Nick-Fury-
This was my first coding assignment in grade 10 ICSO0 intro to CS class
/*instructions
 at the start screen of the program the helicarrier can be moved using A and D on the keyboard
 if enter is pressed the program works
 The music will be playing to stop it press P on the keyboard
 to open the "Shield AI" press on the shield logo top left 
 the shield AI menu will pop up, press on the wanted catg. to open it
 the Combat system it clears the "planes and clouds" and leaves a pointer to shoot lasers into nothing
 there is a mega laser that charges and charges slower as u shoot the normal laser
 the lasers work as the mouse is DRAGGED
 the megalaser works until mouse is released even if it isnt fully drained
 the contacts contains 3 contacts (voice lines from marvel movies)
 press on the wanted contact to start the voice line
 the menu button goes  back to start screen where there is a hellicarrier third person view and it can be controlled A and D
 the Game button starts a replica of space invaders that is just 1 circle(enemy) and shoots one laser at a time with the score being frame controlled in the code
 the ship can work using the right and left arrows and the up arrow shoots the lasers
 for every enemy hit a new one starts in a random spawn zones (there is around 8 spawn areas)
 for every enemy you get 10 points
 it is possible to restart the game when it's over if the blue circle is pressed in the middle
 
 Extras:
 the sheild logo stays open while the shield AI is on, but if pressed the sheild AI can close
 when a sub menu or game is open the back key returns you back to the main one
 
 
 Finally :
 Esc (by default in processing) closes the program
 pressing ctrl+shift+r starts the program in full screen
 it takes a bit to load with the sound files
 
 DISCLAIMER this doesn't use an actual AI but that was just used in the name because it sounded 'cool'
